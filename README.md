# Diabetes Prediction using SVM Classifier

This repository contains a Python script for predicting diabetes using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The script utilizes the `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` libraries for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Summary

The project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. It involves the following steps:

  1. Loading the dataset from a CSV file.
  2. Preprocessing the data by standardizing features using `StandardScaler`.
  3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  4. Training a SVM classifier using the training data.
  5. Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy score.
  6. Predicting the likelihood of diabetes for new input data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
